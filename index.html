                        We like making things happen. Many students often have ideas for new products, tech startups, events, etc. However, many of those same students do not know where to start. RESOLV can get you on the right track. We have quite a few projects in the works (some of which are listed below), and are always looking for new ventures. We hold our own and get people into hackathons, try to improve the community around us in whatever ways we can.

                                    RESOLV is a strong advocate for breathing clean air and would love for you to join us in helping the UNT campaign for a smoke free campus to be a success! Breathing in second hand smoke is considered to be more dangerous than actually smoking cigarettes, which has been the leading cause of lung cancer and emphysema for years, not to mention dental problems. RESOLV and UNT would both like to encourage students to be as healthy as possible. Smoking does not just put you at risk, but it puts your friends, your family, and innocent strangers in harm's way as well. Even if you have never had a loved one die from lung cancer or experienced the horrors that cigarettes cause first hand, you can still take part in this effort to save the lives of others by the means of education and encouragement or even by helping us to do the same and spread the word.
